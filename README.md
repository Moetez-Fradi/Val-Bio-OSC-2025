# Val-Bio-OSC-2025
As an AI engineer, this repository documents my research, work, and conclusions during my internship at Valbio as an Orange Digital Center intern.

## About the startup

After 12 years of research in the field of plasturgy, Mr. Mohamed Medhaffer developed an innovative process to combine plastic waste and biomass into new biodegradable plastic granules. Valbio produces and sells these granules to large manufacturers that use them for molding products such as boxes, tables, chairs and more.

## Machine de Tri 

During my internship, I developed an AI powered sorting system for Valbio’s recycling process, after collecting over 1000 samples from the startup's stock of plastic waste. The system uses NIR sensors and machine learning algorithms to identify and classify different types of plastic waste into one of three classes: PP, PE and OTHERS. The accuracy over the dataset reached over 92% and showed good performance under normal conditions, the intensity of the environment's light still caused some issues due to the sensor's sensitivity. This improved the efficiency and accuracy of the sorting line, reducing manual labor and contamination in the input materials.

## Machine de filament

we also worked on a filament production process that converts Valbio’s biodegradable granules into 3D printing filament.

## Site Vitrine + Chatbot

I developed and deployed Valbio’s showcase website at https://valbio.osc.tn and integrated a conversational AI chatbot powered by RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). The chatbot delivers instant, accurate responses about products, production processes, and sustainability initiatives, enhancing user engagement and automating customer support.
